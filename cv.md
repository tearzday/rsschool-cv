## About US

My life has been about code for a long time and it's one of the things that affects my thinking. Also, as banal as it may sound, I am very punctual in my work, I can't rest easy on my day off if I know that I haven't done something in time. I easily compromise, I am always curious to learn new knowledge and experience from my colleagues. I have never encountered any conflicts or misunderstandings at any of my jobs. Most of my friends are my colleagues, either we have worked together before and keep in touch, or we are currently working together. Unfortunately, the campaigns where I've worked are not really suitable for growth beyond HTML-versatile, so my goal is of course technical growth. It's fun to be a painter and paint buttons, of course, but working with different algorithms is more appealing to me.

## Technology Stack

1. **Basic technologies:**
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript

2. **Framework**
- Vue 3
- Vuex

3. **Other**
- GIT
- Node JS
- axios
- Knowledge of OOP and functional programming
- Knowledge of SPA
- Various algorithms (bubble sorting, linear search, etc.)

## Code Example
I have 6 kyu in CodeWars

**Description**
Create a function that will trim a string (the first argument given) if it is longer than the requested maximum string length (the second argument given). The result should also end with "..."

These dots at the end also add to the string length.

For example, trim("Creating kata is fun", 14) should return "Creating ka..."

If the string is smaller or equal than the maximum string length, then simply return the string with no trimming or dots required.

e.g. trim("Code Wars is pretty rad", 50) should return "Code Wars is pretty rad"

If the requested string length is smaller than or equal to 3 characters, then the length of the dots is not added to the string length.

e.g. trim("He", 1) should return "H...", because 1 <= 3

Requested maximum length will be greater than 0. Input string will not be empty.

**Result**
`const trim = (str, size) => (str.length > size && size > 3)?str.slice(0 , size - 3) + '...':(str.length <= size)?str:str.slice(0 , size) + '...'`


## Work experience

Commercial work experience for 3 years. I worked as an HTML layout designer for advertising campaigns. My duties included development of websites with products for advertising, as well as development of internal systems, various technical support for the site and similar related things. Most of the time I'm like a kind of painter, repaint here, move here. But there were also quite interesting projects, where Vue3, Nuxt, Vutifay, Tailwind were used, working with various queries and other features that I had to think about.

## Education 
- **Bachelor's degree in "Fundamental Informatics and Information Technologies" at ASU university**
- Courses and similar material have been plentiful. **Free part of HTML Acadmey, html and css courses from code-basic, courses on git, courses from postgresql**.
- Also a big layer of knowledge is tutorials and documentation, for example, **learn.javascript tutorial, MDN, documentation for VUE**.
- And of course YouTube, one of my favorite frontend related channels is Ulbi TV.
